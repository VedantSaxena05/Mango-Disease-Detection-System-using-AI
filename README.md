"# Mango-Disease-Detection-System-using-AI" <br>
Mango Leaf Disease Detection using CNN is an AI-powered deep learning project designed to classify diseases in mango leaves using image-based convolutional neural networks. The system accurately identifies six categories—Healthy, Anthracnose, Bacterial Canker, Die Back, Gall Midge, and Powdery Mildew—by training on a curated dataset of over 2,000 labeled images. Built using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras, the model achieves over 95% accuracy by leveraging data augmentation and regularization techniques to improve generalization. The project includes a clean image preprocessing pipeline using OpenCV and NumPy, and the model was evaluated with validation metrics and a confusion matrix to ensure class-wise performance. This solution is designed for agricultural use cases, with future potential to integrate into a smart irrigation system that responds to disease detection in real time. The project demonstrates skills in computer vision, model training, and practical deployment, and it can be extended with a Streamlit or Flask-based web app to enable user-friendly predictions from uploaded leaf images.
